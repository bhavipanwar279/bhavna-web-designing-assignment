# Travel Adventures


This project, "Travel Adventures," is a basic single-page website created with plain HTML. It serves as an example of introductory web development concepts and provides an overview of a fictional travel agency.

## About the Project

*   A main header with a welcome message.
*   An "About Us" section that includes bolded, italicized, and struck-through text to demonstrate text formatting.
*   A section dedicated to displaying featured images.
*   The use of the `<img>` tag with a data URI to embed an image directly into the HTML file.
*   Horizontal rules (`<hr>`) to visually separate content sections.

## Technologies Used
